You Are Infinite!

The Truth is Infinite and you are the Truth!

[A man lived once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hallaj#Teachings_and_practices). He was so happy that he saw the Truth. The Truth was that he was he Truth. He ran down the streets shouting "I am The Truth!".

We are the Truth. And the Truth is Infinite. We are never going to run out of True things to say.

So we are Infinite. You are Infinite.

And it's time we all started acting like it.
